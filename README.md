# Quiz App Game 🎯

A simple and interactive **Quiz App Game** built with JavaScript that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, track their score, and receive feedback based on their performance.

This project was built as part of **Week 2** of my journey in the **Web3Bridge Web2 Cohort XIV (Frontend Development)** while taking the **Web2 Advanced course**.
